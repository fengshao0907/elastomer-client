    # The `bulk` method can be used in two ways. Without a block the method
    # will perform an API call, and it requires a bulk request body and
    # optional request parameters. If given a block, the method will use a
    # Bulk instance to assemble the operations called in the block into a
    # bulk request and dispatch it at the end of the block.
    #
    # See http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/bulk/
    #
    # body   - Request body as a String (required if a block is _not_ given)
    # params - Optional request parameters as a Hash
    #   :request_size - Optional maximum request size in bytes
    #   :action_count - Optional maximum action size
    # block  - Passed to a Bulk instance which assembles the operations
    #          into one or more bulk requests.
    #
    # Examples
    #
    #   bulk(request_body, :index => 'default-index')
    #
    #   bulk(:index => 'default-index') do |b|
    #     b.index(document1)
    #     b.index(document2, :_type => 'default-type')
    #     b.delete(document3)
    #     ...
    #   end
    #
    # Returns the response body as a Hash

    # The Bulk class provides some abstractions and helper methods for working
    # with the ElasticSearch bulk API command. Instances of the Bulk class
    # accumulate indexing and delete operations and then issue a single bulk
    # API request to ElasticSearch. Those operations are then executed by the
    # cluster.
    #
    # A maximum request size can be set. As soon as the size of the request
    # body hits this threshold, a bulk request will be made to the search
    # cluster. This happens as operations are added.
    #
    # Additionally, a maximum action count can be set. As soon as the number
    # of actions equals the action count, a bulk request will be made.
    #
    # You can also use the `call` method explicitly to send a bulk request
    # immediately.
